<div class="notes">
The University of Sussex and American Express recently concluded a significant InnovateUK (formally the UK Technology Strategy Board) project entitled ‘Connecting Virtual Communities to the Digital Economy Through Micro-Payment Technologies’. The project explored how payments and rewards technologies, particularly micro-payments, could be integrated into digital economy applications.
</div>

## The ShareLab's Current Work

Two closely related projects that are underpinned by key IoT and blockchain technologies:

1. Mobile financial wearables and IoT
2. IoT in a sharing economy

## ShareLab Summary

The focus of the ShareLab team are real-world application scenarios and working prototypes of distributed applications (dApps).

## Our Ideas, Rather Than Things

In an interview with RFID Journal<sup>1</sup>, Kevin Ashton, the man credited with coining the phrase _'Internet of Things'_, described the Internet as being dependent on human beings. Hence, the Internet represents our ideas, rather than ‘things’.

<div class="source">
_1. K. Ashton, “That ’Internet of Things’ Thing - RFID Journal.” http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?4986, Jun-2009._
</div>

<div class="notes">
Ashton supposed that humans are time limited, so they are unable to capture too many useful real-world ‘things’ (such as data about the fuel that powers our heating or drives our car’s engines).
</div>

## Efficient

Ashton concluded that an _Internet of Things_ based on computer-generated data would enable us to become more efficient, because: “we would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling”<sup>1</sup>.

## IoT is Cloud Centric

...they have a vision of a _‘cloud-centric IoT’_.

</div>

## However...

+ While the cloud-centric model offers a potential solution to scaling to billions of connected devices, it does not necessarily provide a solution to the security challenges of IoT
+ Furthermore, the security and ownership of data created by IoT is a critical issue.

<div class="notes">
Li et al. list five security and privacy issues that need addressing for IoT: 1) Security and privacy from the social, legal and cultural perspectives, 2) Trust mechanisms, 3) Communication security, 4) User privacy, 5) Security of services and applications.
</div>

## ShareLab's Solution...

Sussex's ShareLab believes the solution to security and privacy issues created by IoT lies in trustless peer-to-peer blockchain technology coupled with a hyperlinked file system, such as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which could help distribute digital assets via links on the blockchain.

<div class="notes">
IPFS works much like the BitTorrent service Pirate Bay.
Such systems overcome security and privacy issues by using public key cryptography. Furthermore, there's no central authority in control. Hence, there's no single point of failure (assuming a functioning Internet).

## Blockchain Overview

</div>

## Essentially a Database

The authors of a report for the UK Government describe the technology as:

_“essentially an asset database that can be shared across a network of multiple sites, geographies or institutions”_<sup>1</sup>

. . .

The [Bitcoin Website FAQ](https://bitcoin.org/en/faq) puts it this way:

_"Blockchains are the most prominent **triple entry bookkeeping system** in existence."_

<div class="source">
_1. [Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond blockchain](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/492972/gs-16-1-distributed-ledger-technology.pdf "Distributed Ledger Technology: Beyond blockchain")_
</div>

## However...

Blockchain technologies have capabilities far beyond any traditional ledger or ordinary asset database.

## Smart Contracts

+ Algorithms that provide a secure mechanism for electronic collaboration which does not rely upon a central authority for trust
+ Include the concept of smart contracts, which helps automate a system’s rule set because they have the ability to execute autonomous scripts that can represent verifiable application logic

## Shared Public Ledger

+ A blockchain is a trusted, shared public ledger that is open to inspection by everyone, but which cannot be controlled by any single entity
+ Distributed network of transactions where the control of write permissions is via public-private key cryptography  

<div class="notes">
Hence, you might argue that blockchains represent an irrevocable representation of the truth because they're a permanent and complete record of every transaction that’s ever taken place (on the blockchain).
In other words, the control of write permissions means that blockchains have an inherent _track changes_ ability.
</div>

## Blockchain Transaction

![](images/AliceBobTransaction.png)

<div class="source">

</div>

<div class="notes">
This example shows Alice buying a cup of coffee from Bob’s coffee shop. Alice spends BTC with Bob by using a BTC wallet on her smartphone. She does so by scanning a two-dimensional barcode, known as a QR code, of the payment request generated from Bob’s BTC enabled point-of-sale system. That contains Bob’s destination address, how much Alice should pay and the written description of the trade.

Alice pays Bob for his cup of coffee by creating new outputs from the inputs of a previous transaction with Joe, who used Alice’s public key as the destination address for the BTC involved. When Alice uses some of those funds to pay Bob for his coffee, she supplies her private key to unlock them. That ensures that those transactions are read-only to every other user on the BTC network because it is impossible for anyone to modify them without knowing Alice’s private key. Once the network is satisfied Alice has a sufficient number of BTC to cover the necessary outputs for the transaction with Bob, the required BTC are transferred using Bob’s public key. That encumbers that output with the requirement that, to spend the amount transferred, Bob must produce his private key. In other words, it represents a secure transfer of value between Alice and Bob.

Security of the transfer is enforced by the timestamping and hashing functions of the validators on the Bitcoin network, who form a chain of final transactions. That ensures that even Alice, with her private key, can’t modify confirmed transactions, since it is technically infeasible; she would have to change all the blocks in the chain to change a single block. In 2014, a computing array with the power of 1,753,694 PetaFLOPS would have been needed to make a fake block on the BTC blockchain. At the time, the world’s fastest supercomputer, the Chinese Tianhe–2, could manage 33.9 PetaFLOPS. That means over 50,000 Tianhe–2 supercomputers would be required to attempt to create the fake block.

## Types of Blockchain

Bitcoin, the original blockchain technology, is an open source GitHub project. Hence, any developer can fork the code. Since its launch, Bitcoin has spawned some alternative blockchains:

+ Ethereum
+ Ripple
+ Litecoin
+ Stellar

## AutoPay

<div class="source">

</div>

<div class="notes">
Jane gets into her car to drive to work; she’s a busy mother and senior manager for a large corporate. The car automatically synchronises with Jane’s smart phone’s AutoPay service, a system that provides security and trust by ‘embodying’ Jane through smart contracts on its blockchain interface. That allows it to operate as an Autonomous Payment device. AutoPay initiates several features on Jane’s in-car display; it links to Journey Planner (JP), and Jane enters into AutoPay JP her office as her destination. AutoPay JP determines, by interrogating vehicle data, that the car is low on fuel, so it automatically plots a route via a convenient petrol station that is advertising competitive fuel prices. After filling up with fuel (automatically paid for by AutoPay’s smart contract feature), Jane receives a message over the AutoPay Siri interface that her work car park is full and that AutoPay JP has initiated a smart contract exchange and paid for another car park, a short distance from her office.

While at work, Jane receives a message that SmartBasket has tendered her daily shopping list to local retailers, determined the one with the best prices, paid for it all, and has organised delivery, which arrives soon after Jane gets home from work. Later that same evening, Jane’s daughter, Alice, asks to borrow the car. Alice’s smart contract with Jane’s car gives her access, but it does not enable the vehicle to make autonomous payments for everything; smart contracts are precisely that; smart, they are customisable for each family member. So, Alice can refuel, but she can’t treat her friends to a drive through MacDonalds using her mother’s AutoPay service. Besides, even if Alice were able to pay for things she should not, Jane would quickly find out because she would be able to check the immutable transaction history on AutoPay’s interface to the car’s blockchain’s ledger.

## Digital Rights Management

<div class="source">

</div>

<div class="notes">
2012 was the first year that electronic sales of songs surpassed those of their physical counterparts. However, that has not dawned a golden age for music because of problems with the distribution and monetisation of digitised copyrighted material. Then there are a myriad of rights; sync rights, mechanical royalties, songwriter royalties and performance fees. As a consequence, streaming revenue can go to many services, and the artists themselves rarely receive much more than a tiny percentage of the monies generated.

Imogen Heap tried to overcome all that by releasing her latest song, Tiny Human, on the prototype music platform ujo music, which uses blockchain technology to detail under what terms the track may be downloaded. The technology also describes how automated payments are distributed to the song’s different contributors. Furthermore, when someone streams the song, the transaction is permanently recorded on the blockchain, which makes it amenable to all kinds of data visualisations and data mining techniques. Moreover, Heap receives immediate payment. That in itself could be a game changer since, currently, it can take months for an artist to receive their royalty payments.  

However, Tiny Human is still centrally stored. To support the distributed model, Heap could make the song available on IPFS, via a link on the blockchain. Thus, it would maximise Heap’s opportunities for revenue because her song could achieve high throughput streaming in a manner that’s fault tolerant.

Music is not the only medium that could benefit from the blockchain and IPFS model. Any digital assets could be distributed that way, with huge implications for electronic media. Legal systems currently consider such intangible assets as non-rivalrous, which means that digital media has long since been caught in the quagmire of intellectual property law because there is, supposedly, no way to prevent their duplication. The result is that users own practically no online material; instead, they merely license such material. However, because blockchain technology has mechanisms that resist falsification and duplication, it could change that and make intangible assets rivalrous. Furthermore, blockchains do that at a very low cost, which supports the type of micropayment models required by music streaming services. Hence, we imagine a future of transparent ownership and use of all digital assets, via blockchains.

## Leftover Foreign Currency

</div>

<div class="notes">
A study from Zopa indicates that the British alone have an estimated UK£2.92 billion of leftover foreign currency. If the UK situation scales to the global population, then there’s a considerable amount of wealth lying unused.

Imagine a scenario whereby, after returning home to London from a business trip to Chicago, John has with him some United States Dollars (USD) that he no longer needs. At the airport gate, using a bespoke smartphone _foreign exchange_ application, he finds the location of the nearest currency-accepting IoT-enabled smart kiosk. John holds his smartphone close to the booth, which identifies him using near-field communication technology (NFC) to exchange a smart contract via a blockchain application.

John deposits his USD and instantly gets an electronic receipt of the deposit using another blockchain based smart contract exchange. Later,
John posts his USD to GBP exchange rate using an intelligent system application that stays competitive by adjusting automatically using the latest mid-market rates. John soon receives an alert that someone has traded, via a smart contract, at his advertised price and the money has been transferred into John’s bank account.

## The Internet of Things and Blockchain Technology

Sussex's ShareLab believes that Blockchain technology could become the secure backbone of the Internet of Things, able to track device history and allowing smart systems to become autonomous agents.

. . .

Indeed, we believe that it is the blockchain’s trustless public ledger, coupled with a distributed file system model provided by, for example, IPFS, that will address the security, transparency and scaling challenges offered by IoT.
